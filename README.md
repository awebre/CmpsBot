# CmpsBot

A bot for SELU's Computer Science Discord Server.

## Initial Purpose

SELU's Computer Science Discord Server Mods need help creating a consistant onboarding experience as the server grows. This bot will provide that experience. Our first goal is to send new members a message with instructions for changing their nickname in the server and with an abridged version of the server rules.

As this grows, we'll take feature requests from the community and organize around our favorite ideas.

## Contributing to this Project

If you would like to contribute to this project, feel free to create a Pull Request. We will track issues and goals of the project using GitHub Issues, but broader discussions about the bot will happen in the bot's dedicated channel within the Discord server. As a general reminder, **all feature requests will first need to receive approval from the mods**.
